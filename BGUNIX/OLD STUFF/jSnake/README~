README
====================

This program utilizes different linked list classes.  The primary 
list class used for the final project was the scoresList list.
This list contains a copy constructor, overloaded operators, and 
has the ability to read and write between the linked list and
a file. 

====================
OVERLOADED OPERATORS
====================
operator=()	copies the contents of a list
operator==()	compares list size
operator!=()	compares list size
operator+()	compares list size
operator>()	compares list size
operator<()	compares list size
operator>=()	compares list size
operator<=() 	compares list size
====================
MORE OVERLOADED OPERATORS
====================
The other classes used in this program all contain their own 
overloaded operators (and constructors/desctructors).  The most
used overloaded operator in this program was the operator== 
comparison of the listNode class.  This would check the (x,y)
coordinates of the nodes being compared and return true if
they were the same.  I did not overload the complementary 
operator!= of the class because I wanted it to use the 
default behavior specifically.
====================
EXTRA FEATURES
====================
My entire program is essentially "extra features", with
the scoresList class playing a small role in handling the
game's high scores list.  One of the most obvious extra features
is using the curses.h library to manipulate the terminal in 
ways beyond what was covered in class.
