 	<PRE>Torrent simulator
	
Objective: show how a torrent works

Questions:
Should each seeder and leech have the same properties? Will be one and the same class: peer.
Language? Java?

Networking
	How in-depth will connections be simulated?
		Connections will consist of a mesh between all users, consisting of node and connection capacities.
		Ex. User1's NODE has 100Mbit download connection, with 10Mbit upload connection.

How will packets/sections be simulated?
	Each section has a size. The connection will be classified as 100Mbit format speed.
	When a section is being transferred, it will "move" along the connection line.
	Speed will be calculated accordingly. Ex. 50MB section tansferred in 4 seconds if has full upload speed.
Section/Packet competition:
	Each connection will be shared equally between section. 2 sections each get 50% of the connection..
	

Sending section protocol:
	1.	B wants to send to A (established in torrent rules and protocols)
		Worry about later. Choose random indexes for now...
	2.	B considers both nodes' connection and node speeds. Lowest of B.in,B.out,A.in,A.out,AB.speed limits max Speed.
		Traffic is also considered; (AB.speed/AB.traffic+1), (B.in/B.traffic+1), (A.in/A.traffic+1). Smallest of which determines actual speed.
	3.	Once a traffic limit is calculated, the traffic is added to the connection/node, and other transmission speeds are updated.
	4.	Visual object is created and added. Size of square is proportional to section size. Progress/speed is equal to size/(speed/traffic)
	5.	Every tick, object location is updated by one second.

Receiving section protocol:
	1.	Section reaches 100% progress (event)
	2.	Section visual is removed
	3.	Receiver status is updated accordingly
	4.	Connection/Nodes are updated; -1 traffic.

Objects:
	Peer
		UserID
		In/Out Nodes
			Stack of objects
			Max Speed
		Torrent
			Sections complete (bool array)
			Other stats (worry about later)
		Connection[]

	Section
		SectionID
		SectionIndex (ex. part 5 of 32)

	Connection
		FullDuplexSpeed
		User1
		User2

Plan: Agile Approach

	Create Peer Object
	Create Connection/Node
	Create preliminary protocol; Tick() function
	Create basic 2 peer system

	Expand and polish

	Get to many users/connections

	Add visuals
